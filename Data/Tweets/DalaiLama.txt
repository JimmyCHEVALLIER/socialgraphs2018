Change in the world always begins with an individual who shares what he or she has learned and passes it on to others.
The most crucial use of knowledge and education is to understand the importance of developing a good heart.
We all want to live a happy life, which is our right, and the key to doing so is developing compassion for others.
We need to improve the current education system by introducing instructions on ways to cultivate positive emotions like warm-heartedness.
Compassion brings inner peace and whatever else is going on, that peace of mind allows us to see the whole picture more clearly.
Compassion is the essence of a spiritual life—to be successful in practicing love and compassion, patience and tolerance are indispensable.
New from HHDL &amp; Archbishop Desmond Tutu, the Book of Joy Journal with inspiring quotes to help find joy in our lives https://t.co/lwA2Rvean4
I’m convinced that today’s young people can achieve a more peaceful world if they cultivate warm-heartedness and inner peace.
The more compassionate our mind, the more we’ll be able to lead our lives transparently, honestly, truthfully, with nothing to hide.
People go to great lengths to look physically attractive, but inner beauty is a more important and stronger basis for lasting relationships.
As social animals we need friends and what attracts them is trust. And trust grows when we show real concern for others’ well-being.
Peace doesn’t come from prayer alone, it requires us to take action. Our goal should be a demilitarized world. #PeaceDayChallenge
Whatever our religious faith, showing others loving kindness is the best way to bring about inner peace.
What we need today are universal values based not on faith but on scientific findings, common experience and common sense.
I’m just one human being, but I believe each one of us has a responsibility to contribute to a happier humanity.
Religious people pray for peace, but prayer alone is not enough, what will bring peace in the world is people cultivating peace of mind.
As a human brother I'm committed to letting people know that we all possess the seeds of love and compassion.
Using harsh words reflects narrow-mindedness—to be happy and joyful we need friends. Friendship is based on trust and treating others kindly
Just as we protect our health by observing physical hygiene, by tackling our destructive emotions with skill we’ll achieve emotional hygiene
You may control people physically by force, but you won’t change their hearts and minds—that requires trust and friendship.
By learning to be more warm-hearted we can create a more compassionate world.
Watch HHDL's message to the Mind &amp; Life meeting on Spirituality, Science and Humanity held in Botswana on August 17. https://t.co/og6c0ttHhZ
When I heard scientists say they had evidence that basic human nature is compassionate, I thought, 'There’s real hope.'
Inner beauty, warm-heartedness and compassion, is what brings about peace of mind.
Fear and suspicion won’t help us live together. We have to cultivate warm-heartedness.
If we were really to see one another as brothers and sisters, there would be no basis for division, cheating and exploitation among us.
We all want to live a happy life, so we have to learn to live together in trust and mutual respect.
If you have a warm heart and you care for others you'll be happy and the community in which you live will be happier too.
Education today needs not only to develop our intelligence, but also to support basic human values of warm-heartedness and compassion.

We experience happiness on a sensory level that is relatively short-lived. But lasting happiness is related to our state of mind.
Compassion brings us peace of mind. It brings a smile to our face and genuine smiles bring us closer together.
On a mental level kindness and compassion give rise to lasting joy. They reduce fear.
A more peaceful world and a more peaceful century require that we rely not on weapons but on developing a widespread inner peace.
Live: HHDL's talk on "Embracing the Beauty of Diversity in our World" from UC San Diego on June 16th. https://t.co/cowTiKnH9w
We are all social animals and compassion, care and concern for others bring us together.
Having a calm and compassionate mind enables us to use our natural intelligence more effectively.
Protecting our environment is not a luxury we can choose to enjoy, but a simple matter of survival.
Peace in the world depends on our relating to each other with compassion.
Although bringing about inner change is difficult, it is absolutely worthwhile to try. What is important is to try our best.
Motivation is very important. We can show love, respect for others, and honesty in whatever we do to help humanity.
If human society loses the value of justice, compassion, and honesty, the next generation will face greater difficulties and more suffering.
The happiness of childhood, the calming of a child's fears and the healthy development of its self-confidence depend directly upon love.
HHDL recalls his mother's affection in this clip from his talk the University of Minnesota in 2011. https://t.co/cVqwO5YoHt
Money and power attract friends. But it’s not you they’re friends with — just your money and power. Only affection brings genuine friends.
If in day to day life you lead a good life, honestly, with love, compassion, and less selfishness, then automatically you will find peace.
The future can be different if we choose to make it so. There is no time for complacency, hope lies in what action we take.
Anger may seem to be a source of energy, but it’s blind. It causes us to lose our restraint. It may stir courage, but that too is blind.
HHDL speaks of the hope for a future compassionate world if we make effort now from his talk in Delhi on April 27th. https://t.co/CJkOvvzAZh
It is in the nature of the mind that the more we cultivate and familiarize ourselves with positive emotions, the more powerful they become.
This Earth Day we need a greater sense of global responsibility based on our belonging to one human family.
While material development contributes to physical comfort, mental comfort depends on compassion, which expresses itself as nonviolence.
It is not enough simply to wish that love and compassion grow within us. We need a sustained effort to cultivate such positive qualities.
The aim of spiritual practice is to transform and perfect our motivation and mental disposition, so we can become better human beings.
Positive emotions like compassion and loving kindness engender in us a deep sense of peace and serenity, and benefits others as well.
We can make this a more peaceful century if we cherish non-violence and concern for others’ well-being.
Some scientists have found evidence to show that basic human nature is compassionate. This is a really hopeful sign.
All religions have the potential to create better human beings—but no one religion can claim supremacy over the other.
To really be of help to others we need to be guided by compassion.
Caring for others is the best way to fulfil our own interests. We are social animals; we need to be warm-hearted and to take care of others.
John Oliver speaks to the Dalai Lama aired on HBO, March 5th. https://t.co/MPlnCPpn3I
Love and compassion are important, because they strengthen us. This is a source of hope
We have to cultivate a vision of a happier, more peaceful future and make the effort now to bring it about.
The purpose of education is to build a happier society, we need a more holistic approach that promotes the practice of love and compassion.
It's not what work we choose to do, the crucial point is doing it with a positive and altruistic motivation.
Be a kind and compassionate person. This is the inner beauty that is a key factor to making a better world.
Inner peace helps sustain good health, gives rise to happy individuals, happy families, happy communities and ultimately a happy humanity.
Be honest, truthful and warm-hearted. Make compassion the basis of your determination.
If our goal is a happier, more peaceful world in the future, only education will bring change.
The ultimate source of happiness for self and others is compassion, concern for others and being of service to them.
We know that everyone who is born has to die, but the important thing is that while we are alive we should make our lives meaningful.
If there can be a greater sense of oneness in the world, then violence and killing will end.
When we talk about happiness, we must think in terms of peace of mind, which is a real source of joy.
