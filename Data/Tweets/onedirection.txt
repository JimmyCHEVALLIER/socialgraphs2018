RT @Harry_Styles: Wow, Eight years has passed. Thank you for all the love, thank you for all the support. Thank you for everything. I love…
And now I'm one step closer to being two steps far from you, when everybody wants you, everybody wants you #8YearsofOneDirection
You can't go to bed without a cup of tea, maybe that's the reason that you talk in your sleep #8YearsofOneDirection
We can make it 'til the end, nothing can come between you and I #8YearsofOneDirection
And if you like midnight driving with the windows down, and if you like going places we can't even pronounce #8YearsofOneDirection
Everybody wanna steal my girl, everybody wanna take her heart away #8YearsofOneDirection
I've been thinking about it lately, does it ever drive you crazy, just how fast the night changes? #8YearsofOneDirection
I know we only met but let's pretend it's love and never, never, never stop for anyone #8YearsofOneDirection
Baby, say yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah and let me kiss you! #8YearsofOneDirection
RT @NiallOfficial: #8YearsfOneDirection Wow! 8 years of amazing memories with the lads . Thank you so much for standing by us for all this…
RT @LiamPayne: #8YearsOfOneDirection what an incredible 8 years it’s been with my brothers! Thank you to all the fans that are still suppor…
But now we're together we're alone, and there's no other place I'd ever wanna go #8YearsofOneDirection
The story of my life, I take her home, I drive all night to keep her warm #8YearsofOneDirection
Baby you light up my world like nobody else #8YearsofOneDirection
I wanna love like you made me feel when we were 18 #8YearsofOneDirection
RT @Louis_Tomlinson: #8YearsOfOneDirection Where has the time gone!? Thank you so much to every single person who’s ever supported us. Big…
I'm half a man at best, with half an arrow in my chest #8YearsofOneDirection
In the heat where you lay, I could stay right here and burn in it all day #8YearsofOneDirection
If I didn't have you I'd never see the sun, you taught me how to be someone #8YearsofOneDirection
We knew every line now I can't remember, how it goes but I know that I won't forget her #8YearsofOneDirection
Baby they don't know about, they don't know about us #8YearsofOneDirection
So get out, get out, get out of my head, and fall in to my arms instead #8YearsofOneDirection
For your eyes only, I show you my heart, for when you're lonely and forget who you are #8YearsofOneDirection
So I built you a house from a broken home and I wrote you a song with the words you spoke #8YearsofOneDirection
It's gotta be you, only you. It's gotta be you, only you #8YearsofOneDirection
Baby you and me, stumbling in the street, singing, singing, singing, singing! #8YearsofOneDirection
And as you close your eyes tonight, I pray that you will see the light, that's shining from the stars above #8YearsofOneDirection
You and me got a whole lot of history, we could be the greatest team that the world has ever seen! #8YearsofOneDirection
