@Joe51844719 We like to imagine we're petting his nose and ear with our thumbs.
@BatchGamingTV Good times! Best of luck on that chicken dinner hunt.
@IronbaneDK Happy to hear that. Looks like you'll have plenty to keep you busy through the holidays!
@Vyziul üëç Have fun!
@NERDvsGAMES Crushing goals and streaming games. Keep it up!
@Vyziul Yep, you can just insert the disc and your Xbox will begin downloading the game.
@Vyziul It surely is. :)
Looks like fog‚Äôs rolling in. The new Shrouded Spoils update is now available for #SeaOfThieves:‚Ä¶ https://t.co/jvdxoU4o3s
@TeffyTheOtaku We have such great memories from Halo 2! Thinking about replaying the campaign?
@SickSpinning Yess! üôå Which game is up first on the new X?
@OneNOnlyRybeck That's the best feeling. Enjoy!
@Bluewar0 We suppose the only way to find out would be to try it! You could also check in with the game developers‚Ä¶ https://t.co/3FoDM5qcwX
@Nanobanano6 It's always good to see one of the classics back in action.  Have fun playing it again.
@OhwowwO Look at that progess! Keep up the awesome work.
@itslivallen Haha, awesome. Are you schooling them in Fortnite too?
@DeepBlueBeard We'd recommend it! Free, no-noise power and water for every settlement. Hard perk to beat.
@DJNintendo Moving from red to black... we love it!
@StrikerObi Both of the Ori games will be on Game Pass! You might like ReCore as well.
@StrikerObi Yay! What kind of games are you usually into?
@M0nsterBeer Not too shabby at all! Where are most of those points coming from?
@Justin_Goodson That's tough. What's the best Xbox game YOU'VE played?
@spaisner7 That game is so hard to put down! How is it on the new X?
@kevpoacherim So how does it compare to Battlefield 1 for you?
@snoockumstream Pictures from the streaming command center! Have fun.
@DJNintendo Can't have like a... blue controller. That would just be crazy.
@StanTheDryBear Same! We're hyped to load it up on the Xbox One.
@FalconSpartan1 Nice ride! Thanks for sharing the pic.
@BoardsoK Sounds like you had some adventures together. What was the strangest place you ever tried to set it up?
@Zjake12 That's awesome! Thanks for picking it up.
@MacySegars That's true love. üíö
@Eganator2000 Amazing work! What class were you playing?
@Kevinsherratt1 Good luck! How close is your nearest competition?
@Jay75247593 Started a feline Spartan program, apparently.
@paige_spalding Oh, we know that feeling! You just want to give it to them right away!
@wavypsalms It's always nice to find a new favorite. How's the career shaping up?
@ctcmore Cool! What have you gotten done so far?
@DJNintendo Awesome! We see you've got a color theme going on there.
@setsua28 That has some weight, coming from a true connoisseur.
@setsua28 Some games just never get old.
@DeepBlueBeard Builder is SUPER useful, FYI.
@realscheka Not too small, where it's a pain to fold the corners. Not too big, which is the nightmare of double wrapping sheets.
@vault_huntr Life is Strange and Forza Horizon 4:  Feels and wheels.
@MarcoKaatz Report the account for spam, Marco. That's the easiest way to get the right eyes on it.
@itwasthewiz We look forward to having you in the family!
@dt842011 Have fun revisiting one of our fav OG titles!
@DrVortx Strange, we wouldn't mind getting these clothes for Christmas.
@ElraimanX Time to stroll down memory lane... under heavy enemy fire.
@itwasthewiz **ahem**
@simplyycass We love the Marvel Super Heroes and Harry Potter collection, but you really can't go wrong!
@War_Pigeons You get all the naps you want.
@pierced_lady Well then you are in for a treat!
@ForzaLiveryGuy @xboxuk Holiday cheer for everyone!
@realscheka And the boxes make perfectly sized presents to put under any tree. üëç
@setsua28 It's about time for a fresh playthrough.
@dark1x These are the kind of memories you'll both cherish. üíö
@DeepBlueBeard One legacy card down, three more to go.
@simplyycass We gotchu. üòâ
@TGamefather So Gamefather, what is a game we can't refuse?
@simplyycass The LEGO games are often a hit with kids! (and adults too, who are we kidding)
@xl_Sparticus_lx Sounds like a great event! Good luck to all the competitors.
@CrownEss0 That's some quality family content right there.  10/10.

@pierced_lady Yes! What are you playing first?
@vanessarutsatz Q.U.B.E. 2 is a blast if you love puzzle games, enjoy! üíö
@SAMURAIYASUMA The tools of the trade.  Great setup!
@AxiosBattalion Are you a cat?
@Alisaurer It's like the regular Spartan Program, but with more naptime.
@mortem_feruntur Looking good, Clint!
@NAtcheson16 It's cool to see an original title like Mercenaries coming to Games with Gold. Have fun with it!
@toe77300 It is! We had a lot of fun playing it back in the day. Time to dust off those old skills!
@Alisaurer Whoa. It appears you also live with the most stoic cat known to men.
@Majestic_Megzy The triumphant return!
@TheAsgardian We like that deer at the end. "Nope. Not getting involved with that."
This curse isn't going to end itself. Put an end to the curse of the Thrice Damned with the Strange Brigade and all‚Ä¶ https://t.co/YFBj85PCTl
@TsukaretaSenshi Nice! It was definitely an epic installment in the series. We can't wait to load it up again.
@iconic_heroes You're doing an awesome job!
@Alisaurer Same tho.
@DeepBlueBeard We hope your settlement is coming along well! Keeping those zombie attacks out?
@Motty86 There are a lot of similarities, we think you'll enjoy it!
@iconic_heroes You only ever see the Master Chief's back if you're on his side.  Amazing work on the costume!
@Antitinkerbell Banter is our favorite kind of discourse.
@KeepPoundN352 The Chief has no time to watch your Instagram story.
@TraskCaleb48 Fun and free make for a great combo.
You‚Äôll want to check your list more than twice when it looks this good.Which one would make the best gift for you?‚Ä¶ https://t.co/ULzdu9BWCk

@itsbrookieyall Well, thanks for reminding us, the game deserves another playthrough!
@NyteTide Ohh, good call. Just give her some noise-cancelling headphones, quietly disappear, and let the game do the rest!
@aw3som3dud322 Congrats on that upgrade to the X! Battlefield 5 is a fantastic place to start.
@thepyro Our favorite way to play: A single playthrough of story mode followed by excessive amounts of multiplayer. üëç

@NyteTide Ohhh, We see that new upgrade! Congrats on the Xbox One X. Are you and the kids going to be gaming together now?
@painfulrapture1 Oh, awesome. And still the perfect way to break in a new Xbox!

@SeeSorSooS It's pretty cool to see the same scenes, but with the upgraded graphics. You'll love it!
@MeganGough11 Oh no! Can you take it back and swap it out?
@SkwisgaarMike We've been playing it on the Xbox One! Definitely one of the classics from the previous generation.
