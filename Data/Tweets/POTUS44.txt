I'm still asking you to believe - not in my ability to bring about change, but in yours. I believe in change because I believe in you.

The gun lobby may be holding Congress hostage, but they can't hold America hostage. We can't accept this carnage in our communities.
What's often ignored in this debate is that a majority of gun owners agree with commonsense steps to save lives.
We will keep guns out of the wrong hands, enforce our guns laws, and ensure those with serious mental illnesses get treatment.
Tomorrow, I'm taking action to reduce gun violence and save lives - protecting the Second Amendment and our kids. https://t.co/vNqXEhaC9M
Guns now kill as many people as cars in almost half of the U.S. We can't stop every act of violence, but we can save lives if we act.
Each year, more than 30,000 American lives are cut short by guns - two-thirds coming from suicides. Too many Americans have lost loved ones.
From the Obama family to yours, Merry Christmas! And a special thank you to all our men and women in uniform this holiday season.

Slamming the door in the face of refugees would betray our deepest values. That's not who we are. And it's not what we're going to do.
Welcoming the world’s vulnerable who seek the safety of America is not new to us. We've safely welcomed 3 million refugees since 1975.
Here, our focus is giving safe haven to the most vulnerable Syrians – women, children, and survivors of torture.
We will provide refuge to at least 10,000 refugees fleeing violence in Syria over the next year after they pass the highest security checks.
We also win this fight with our values. America can ensure our own security while welcoming refugees desperately seeking safety from ISIL.
Protecting the American people is my top priority. With our 65 global partners, we're leading the campaign to degrade and destroy ISIL.
