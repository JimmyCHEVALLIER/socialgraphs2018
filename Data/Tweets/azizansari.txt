@jratliff3456 @MasterofNone I LOVE THAT SONG. @turquoisewisdom's idea. Same with Townes song at end, so good.
@Video_Game_King Aniz is my brother, read below!
AND our cast: Noel Wells, Eric Wareheim, Kelvin Yu, Lena Waithe, my parents - rehearsed a lot with me and helped refine our dialogue.
Also, Sarah Schneider and Jason Woliner worked on a few episodes too. And our godfather EP, Mike Schur, helped with some writing too.
Harris Wittels (@twittels) wrote many beautiful, hilarious things on the show before he passed and the series is dedicated to him.
Writing staff includes: me, Alan Yang, Aniz Ansari, Sarah Peters, Zoe Jarman, Joe Mande, Andrew Weinberg, Andrew Blitz.
Another note about the show - though most episodes say "written by Aziz and Alan," the whole staff contributes to all the episodes.
Not a mistake, my brother Aniz wrote on the show and came up with many of my favorite jokes. https://t.co/Vz1AS8knPy
