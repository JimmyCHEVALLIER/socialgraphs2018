Hello. Thanks for all of the messages. Nobody got hurt. I don't think I have the best guard dogs in the World.
Who do you think. And who gave the best performance.

Getting in some practice. https://t.co/t8qcYWEXx9

Another question. What would be your favourite theme for an X Factor week. This is for two weeks time.
Thank you.
Does anyone in London sell Corona light beer. We have run out
How incredible was that Fleur performance tonight. One of the best I have ever seen
Looking forward to something which is going to happen on Sunday. And now it's time for bed and a toffee yoghurt.
And Louisa Che and Lauren also fantastic.
They mashed up What makes you Beautiful with Cheerleader. Sounds crazy but it was fantastic.
I LOVE Reggie and Bollie

Hello. In Cabo Mexico this weekend. Our friends birthday.
So let's make this a special year and we want the best of the best to come and audition. There will be lots of surprises in store!
I can't believe that in 2016 we are going to celebrate the 10th series of Britain's Got Talent.
Yes I did apologise to my contestants.
Sorry for swearing on the show tonight. It's not big and it's not clever. Wish Karen Mav had kept a seat.
The six chair challenge starts tonight on The Xfactor. Starts at 7. This is where the competition starts. Simon.
Goodnight.
Thank you. Simon.
They are having a Save The Dogs march Sunday October 4th. Please help to spread the word.
My good friends Lisa Vanderpump and Ken Todd have more info on their Twitter pages.

I know I have mentioned this before. But some friends of mine need your help...
Hello.
Some surprises to come. And hopefully some great performances. Let me knowwhat YOU think and who you like.
I have loved working on the X Factor this year. It's all about the talent. Over the next few weeks things get interesting.
Snobby, ignorant or bitter?
Why do some snotty people who have had huge careers knock bands like the boys and then say but I haven't heard their records
Loved seeing One Direction at the O2 last night. It meant a lot to them. You could see that.
You guys know of my hatred of animal cruelty and this has shocked me
I have just heard about the cruelty to dolphins in Japan, with 1000s facing horrific slaughter in the coming months

Hello
Good night. And as you can see in a happy place tonight. X
And very grateful for all the support to you for watching our shows and the fans of our artists. Said it before but always appreciated. X
And I have been very lucky to have great partners.
And tonight felt positive. Success comes often via friendship and respect. It always takes a team. You don't always recognise that
And how much I recognise how hard the team at Syco work.
Hello. We had our first Summer party tonight for Syco. I realised how many fantastic artists we are lucky to work with.
Keep it in the family is on now. Nuts!
Wasn't the category I was expecting. I did win last year with the Overs so I'm sure we will do great things this year
Hello
You guys have the power this year. Counting on you!
Great singers in this category, but I would be keen to see how another judge would do with the overs this year!
I mentored the overs last year and had the winner and the runner up.
I had a great holiday. And now back to work.
Sorry. I should have said Saturday and Sunday.
As always thank you for watching our show on Saturday. Hope you enjoyed it. And I do listen to you!
Love the boys category but I had three guys in my Overs last year, it would be more fun to mentor something different
.@Cherylofficial had them last year but I've not mentored the girls since Leona, and look what happened! #SimonGirls
I would love to mentor the girls this year.
Have you voted for #SimonGroups yet? I do have the best track record with the groups after all‚Ä¶none of the others can do a better job
The girls category needs an expert and that‚Äôs me! Vote for #SimonGirls
It would be great to mentor the groups, as you saw tonight, there are some amazing ones this year! Vote for #SimonGroups
You get to decide which categories we get to mentor this year. I hope you all make the right decision! Get voting
And your worst
Let me know who your favourite act is on X Factor tonight
I think some of our acts on the Saturday and Sunday shows are special. Wait and see!!! #XFactor
We're back at 8pm tonight. Have seen the first show, love it! Let me know what YOU think. Simon
Goodnight. X

Goodnight..
I have know idea what the show will look like but I feel both excited and nervous. It's going to be very different! Embrace the madness..
We have always had great judges. And I will always be thankful for their passion and expertise.
We met a lot of people. I really believe everyone on the show this year is excited about finding someone who has star potential.
The best kept secret in TV is out!! But I am really happy with the new judging line up for XFactor this year. Its going to be a lot of fun
And today had one of the most delicious ice creams (strawberry) I have ever had. I think the place is called The Ice Cream lab.
